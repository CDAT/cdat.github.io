####<a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014EO420002/abstract">Visualization and Analysis Tools for Ultrascale Climate Data</a>
Increasingly large climate model simulations are enhancing our understanding of the processes and causes of 
anthropogenic climate change, thanks to very large public investments in high-performance computing at national
and international institutions. Various climate models implement mathematical approximations of nature in 
different ways, which are often based on differing computational grids. These complex, parallelized coupled 
system codes combine numerous complex submodels (ocean, atmosphere, land, biosphere, sea ice, land ice, etc.)
that represent components of the larger complex climate system.

####<a target="_blank" href="http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2013/09/mco2013090068-abs.html">IEEE Computer - Ultrascale Visualization of Climate Data - September 2013 (vol. 46 no. 9)</a>
Collaboration across research, government, academic, and private sectors is integrating more than 70 scientific
computing libraries and applications through a tailorable provenance framework, empowering scientists to exchange
and examine data in novel ways.

#### <a target="_blank" href="media/pdf/three-year-comprehensive-report.pdf">UV-CDAT Three Year Comprehensive Report</a>
For the past three years, a large analysis and visualization effort funded by the Department of Energys Office
of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has brought together a wide variety of
industry-standard scientific computing libraries and applications to create Ultra-scale Visualization Climate Data
Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT) to serve the global climate simulation and observational research communities. To
support interactive analysis and visualization, all components connect through a provenance application
programming interface to capture meaningful history and workflow. Components can be loosely coupled into the
framework for fast integration or tightly coupled for greater system functionality and communication with other
components. The overarching goal of UV-CDAT is to provide a new paradigm for access to and analysis of
massive, distributed scientific data collections by leveraging data architectures located throughout the world. The
UV-CDAT framework addresses challenges in analysis and visualization and incorporates new opportunities,
including parallelism for better efficiency, higher speed, and more accurate scientific inferences. Today, it
provides more than 600 users access to more analysis and visualization products than any other single source.
