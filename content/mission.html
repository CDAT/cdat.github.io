## Mission
Building a large distributed system to disseminate and manage large-scale
climate data and resources such as the [Earth System Grid Federation][esgf]
(ESGF) is essential. Equally important is the Ultrascale Visualization Climate
Data Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT) for analyzing, diagnosing, visualizing data for
model-intercomparison projects' observation output, and very high-resolution
climate-model simulations.

Developed by partnering with ESGF and the community to create a larger
problem-solving environment, UV-CDAT is an open source, easy-to-use application
that links together disparate software subsystems and packages to form an
integrated environment for analysis and visualization. This project seeks to
advance climate science by fulfilling computational and diagnostic/visualization
capabilities needed for DOE's climate research.

Led by [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory][LLNL] (LLNL), the consortium
consists of four DOE laboratories ([Los Alamos][LANL],
[Lawrence Berkeley][LBNL], [LLNL], and [Oak Ridge][ORNL]), two universities
([University of Utah][utah] and the
[Polytechnic Institute of New York University][nyu-poly]), [NASA], and two
private companies ([Kitware] and [tech-X]) that will develop reusable software
and workflow analysis and visualization applications for large-scale DOE climate
modeling and measurements archives. The UV-CDAT concept is simple and flexible
enough to interchange parts to expand for future DOE activities.

UV-CDAT can access the ESGF data collections and display results. Parallel
processing, data reduction and analysis take place via ParaView (in the future
also by VisIt) and multiple views are displayed back to users. The workflow
script captures the entire process for reproducibility and knowledge sharing.
