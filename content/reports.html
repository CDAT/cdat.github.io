For the past three years, a large analysis and visualization effort funded by the Department of Energys Office
of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has brought together a wide variety of
industry-standard scientific computing libraries and applications to create Ultra-scale Visualization Climate Data
Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT) to serve the global climate simulation and observational research communities. To
support interactive analysis and visualization, all components connect through a provenance application
programming interface to capture meaningful history and workflow. Components can be loosely coupled into the
framework for fast integration or tightly coupled for greater system functionality and communication with other
components. The overarching goal of UV-CDAT is to provide a new paradigm for access to and analysis of
massive, distributed scientific data collections by leveraging data architectures located throughout the world. The
UV-CDAT framework addresses challenges in analysis and visualization and incorporates new opportunities,
including parallelism for better efficiency, higher speed, and more accurate scientific inferences. Today, it
provides more than 600 users access to more analysis and visualization products than any other single source.
