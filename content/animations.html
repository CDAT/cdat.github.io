## Animations 

####2012

Ben Santer et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) 2013, 
'Identifying human influences on atmospheric temperature', 
animation on multi-model detection and attribution study with climate model simulation output and satellite based measurements of tropospheric and stratospheric temperature change, June 2012.

####2011

Peter Gleckler et al., Nature Climate Change | Letter, 
'Human-induced Global Ocean Warming on Mutildecadal Timescales', 
animation on increases in upper-ocean temperatures. Several studies have used well-established detection and attribution methods to demonstrate that the observed basin-scale temperature changes 
are consistent with model responses to anthropogenic forcing and inconsistent with model-based estimates of natural variability, June 2011.
