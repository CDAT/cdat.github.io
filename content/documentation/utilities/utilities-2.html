##  CDAT Utilities 3.3 - CHAPTER 2

###  CHAPTER 2

####  General Utilities : The genutil Package

The functions in the `genutil` package are written to be general purpose functions that are useful to a broader community and not restricted to climate data applications.

##### Statistics Functions 

Statistics functions available in this package include commonly used functions to compute correlation, covariance, auto-correlation, auto-covariance, lagged correlation, lagged covariance, mean absolute difference, root mean square, standard deviation, variance, geometric mean, median, percentiles and linear regression.

**`correlation`**

Returns the correlation between 2 slabs. By default on the first dimension, centered and biased by default.

**Usage:**

```python
result = correlation(x, y, weights = weightoptions, axis = axisoptions, centered = centeredoptions, biased = biasedoptions )
```

**Options:**

`weightoptions`

default = None. If you want to compute the weighted correlation, provide the weights here.

`axisoptions`: 'x' \| 'y' \| 'z' \| 't' \|  '(dimension_name)' \| 0 \| 1 ... \| n

default value = 0. You can pass the name of the dimension or index (integer value 0...n) over which you want to compute the statistic.

`centeredoptions`: None \| 0 \| 1

default value = 1 removes the mean first. Set to 0 or None for uncentered.

`biasedoptions`: None \| 0 \| 1

default value = 1 returns biased statistic. If want to compute an unbiased
statistic pass anything but 1.

**Example:**

```python
# Let us try an example where we want to look at a
# variable 'tas' from the NCEP reanalysis and compute
# some spatial statistics between data slices for time
# periods from 1960-1970 and 1980-1990.
>>> import cdms
>>> from genutil import statistics
>>> f = cdms.open('tas.rnl_ncep.nc')
>>> ncep1 = f('tas',time=('1960-1-1', '1970-1-1', 'co'))
>>> ncep2 = f('tas',time=('1980-1-1', '1990-1-1', 'co'))
# We have the two time periods extracted.
# Now let us compute the correlation.
>>> cor = statistics.correlation(ncep1, ncep2,\ axis='xy')
# We could compute the spatial correlation weighted by
# area. To accomplish this we can use the 'generate'
# option for weights.
>>> wcor = statistics.correlation(ncep1, ncep2,\ weights='generate', axis='xy')
```

**`linearregression`**

Computes the linear regression of y over x or an axis. This function returns Values of the slope and intercept, and optionally, Error estimates and associated probability distributions for T-value (T-Test) and F-value (for analysis of variance f) can be returned. You can choose to return all these for either slope or intercept or both (default behaviour). For theoretical details, refer to "Statistical Methods in Atmospheric Sciences" by Daniel S. Wilks, Academic Press, 1995.

**Usage:**

```python
result = linearregression(y, axis = axisoptions, x = xvalues, error = erroroptions, probability = probabilityoptions, nointercept = nointerceptoptions, noslope = noslopeoptions )
```

`xvalues`

default = None. You can pass an array of values that are to be used as the independent axis x

`nointerceptoptions` None \| 0 \| 1

default = None. Setting to 0 or None means intercept calculations are returned. To turn OFF the intercept computations set nointercept to 1.

`noslopeoptions` None \| 0 \| 1

default = None. Setting to None or 0 means slope calculations are returned. To turn OFF the slope computations set noslope to 1.

`erroroptions` None \| 0 \| 1 \| 2 \| 3

default = None. If set to 0 or None, no associated errors are returned.

If set to 1, the unadjusted standard error is returned.

If set to 2, standard error returned. This standard error is adjusted using the centered autocorrelation of the residual.

If set to 3, standard error returned. The standard error here is adjusted using the centered autocorrelation of the raw data (y).

`probabilityoptions` None \| 0 \| 1

default = None. If set to 0 or None, no associated probabilities are returned. Set this to 1to compute probabilities.

**Note:**  Probabilities are returned only if erroroptions are set to one of 1, 2, or 3. If it is set to None or 0, then setting probabilityoptions has no meaning. 

##### What is returned?

The returned values depend on the combination of options you select. If both slope and intercept are required, a tuple is returned for both Value and optionally Error (or optionally associated Probabilities), but single values (not tuples) are returned if only one set (slope OR intercept) is required. See examples below for more details.

When `erroroption` = 1 (from description above for erroroptions you know that means unadjusted standard error) and probabilityoption = 1, then the following are returned:

- `pt1` : The p-value for regression coefficient t-value. (With no adjustment for standard error or critical t-value.)
- `None` : There is only one p-value to be returned (pt1) but None is returned to keep the length of the returned values consistent.
- `pf1` : The p-value for regression coefficient F-value (one-tailed).
- `pf2` : The p-value for regression coefficient F-value (two-tailed).

When `erroroption` = 2 or 3 (implying error adjustment using the residual or the raw data and probabilityoption = 1, then the following are returned:

- `pt1` : The p-value for regression coefficient t-value.(With Effective sample size adjustment for standard error of slope.
- `pt2` : The p-value for regression coefficient t-value.(With effective sample size adjustment for standard error of slope and critical t-value.)
- `pf1` : The p-value for regression coefficient F-value (one-tailed).
- `pf2` : The p-value for regression coefficient F-value (two-tailed).

The values pt1 and pt2 are used to test the null hypothesis that b = 0 (i.e., y is independent of x). The values pf1 and pf2 are used to test the null hypothesis that the regression is linear (goodness of linear fit). For non-replicated values of y, the degrees of freedom are 1 and n-2.


##### The `xmgrace` module 

Nothing emphases the fact that CDAT is a collection of tools that can be extended by the user better than the `xmgrace` module. This module provides an interface to the popular Grace plotting utility (which you must have installed separately. Downloads and information are available from http ://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace ).

The tutorials (see the document Climate Data Analysis Tools (CDAT): A beginner's Guide or the  CDAT  home page at http://cdat.sf.net for details) include two tutorials that demonstrate the use of python in getting full use out of XmGrace.

Additional convenience functions 

**`minmax`**

Returns the minimum and maximum of a series of arrays/lists/tuples (or a combination of these). You can combine list/tuples/... pretty much any combination is allowed.

**Examples:**

```python
>>> import genutil
>>> s = range(7)
>>> genutil.minmax(s)
(0.0, 6.0)
>>> genutil.minmax([s,s])
(0.0, 6.0)
>>> genutil.minmax([[s,s*2],4.,[6.,7.,s]],\
[5.,7.,8,(6.,1.)])
(-7.0, 8.0)
```
  
**`grower`**

This function takes 2 transient variables and grows them to match their axes.

**Usage:**

x, y = grower(x, y, singleton = singletonoption )

**Options:**

`singletonoption` 0 \| 1

Default = 0 If `singletonoption` is set to 1 then an error is raised if one of the dims is not a singleton dimension.

**`rgb2str`**

Given r,g,b values, this function returns the closest 'name'

**Example:**

```python
>>> print rgb2str([0,0,0])
'black'
```

##### str2rgb 

Given a string representing a color name, this function the corresponding r,g,b values (between 0 and 255). If the color name is unknown, the function returns `(None, None, None)`

This is accomplished by looking in the /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt file. If the file does not exist, then looks into the builtin dictionary

**Examples:**

```python 
>>> r, g, b = str2rgb('pink2')
# returns: (238, 169, 184 )
>>> r, g, b = str2rgb('crappy')
```
